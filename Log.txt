Trying to add page for each room which will have space for schedule, comments, capacity and booking feature.
Running into problem where the page is not accessable.
Going to check if room is added to database.

Learned about @staticmethod
When you create a method in a class, you can access it using the instance of the class. However, a static method is a method that belongs to the class itself, rather than to any particular instance of the class.

For example, if you have a class called Person and a method called calculate_age, you would normally call it like this:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
person = Person('John', 'Doe', '01/01/1990')
age = person.calculate_age()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, if you make calculate_age a static method, you can call it like this:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
age = Person.calculate_age('01/01/1990')
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This means that you can use the method without creating an instance of the class, which can be useful in certain situations.

tried to add location class to room and messed up the database. now i have to figure out how to fix the database.

but once that works, i believe i should be able to add rooms using Room(location='NAC 9/111')
